    <h1>According to article from IMob</h1>
    <strong><p>Jumong was the founder of Goguryeo in 37 BC. He was the son of General Hae Mo Su and Lady
        Yoo Hwa and was raised by King Geum Wa, who took him and his mother in when Hae Mo Su was believed
        to have been killed in an ambush by the Han Dynasty. So Seo No was a merchant's daughter who helped
         Jumong in realizing his dream to build a new country, 
        and later became his second wife.</p></strong>

    <strong><p>Jumong had the highest ratings of all Korean dramas in 2006 in Korea. I remembered staying 
        awake all night just to watch every episodes of the movie. </p>
